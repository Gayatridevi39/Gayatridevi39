## 🎯 About Me

I am a **results-driven Data Analyst** focused on converting complex, ambiguous data into **clear business decisions** that drive **revenue growth, cost optimization, and risk reduction**.

My work sits at the intersection of **data, business strategy, and storytelling** — where dashboards are not reports, but **decision engines for leadership**.

## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Omnichannel Holiday Retail Analytics  
**Tech:** SQL · Python · Power BI

**Critical Business Problem**
- Strong holiday revenue, but **profit erosion due to high returns and write-offs**
- Leadership lacked visibility into **where losses originate** and **which levers protect margin**

**What I Did (Analytical Outcomes)**
- Quantified **$2.12M total write-off loss** with **11.95% return rate**
- Identified **Wrong Size, Changed Mind, Late Delivery** as primary loss drivers
- Proved **fulfillment & service-level failures** dominate return losses
- Measured **60.33% resale recovery**, offsetting ~60% of return impact
- Revealed **WEB channel** as highest revenue contributor **and highest return-risk**
- Showed **short-span campaigns (1–7 days)** generate **62.87% of total net profit**
- Built **Net Revenue, Contribution Margin, Revenue-at-Risk** metrics beyond topline revenue
- Flagged **holiday campaigns as top ROI drivers**, clearance campaigns as profit destroyers

**Business Outcome**
- Shifted leadership focus from **revenue growth → profit protection**
- Identified **preventable return drivers**, unlocking margin improvement opportunities
- Informed **campaign strategy optimization** (holiday-led, short-span focus)
- Delivered a **CFO-ready decision dashboard** to reduce write-offs and improve ROI

> *I don’t just analyze sales — I protect profit, quantify risk, and guide decisions.*

### 🔹 FinTech Project Management Analytics  
**Tech:** SQL · Python · Power BI

**Critical Business Problem**
- No real-time visibility into **budget overruns, delivery delays, and risk concentration**
- Planned budgets failed to reflect **true financial exposure**
- Lack of prioritization for **high-risk, high-impact projects**

**What I Did (Analytical Outcomes)**
- Analyzed **$105.5M planned vs $54.7M actual spend** across multi-year initiatives
- Forecasted **$153.8M total budget**, identifying a **$48.3M funding gap**
- Quantified portfolio risk:
  - **25% High-risk | 47% Medium-risk | 28% Low-risk**
  - **13.9% delayed projects | 11.1% not started**
- Identified **schedule slippage drivers**, with delays up to **32 days**
- Isolated **project-level budget overruns**, exposing **$1.12M+ cumulative overrun**
- Built **year-wise planned vs actual spend trends**, revealing systemic underestimation
- Created **risk-prioritized views** to surface delayed, high-budget initiatives

**Business Outcome**
- Enabled executives to **see true financial exposure early**
- Supported **capital reallocation away from high-risk, delayed projects**
- Improved **delivery predictability and budget control** at portfolio level
- Equipped CFO / PMO teams with a **decision-ready dashboard** for funding prioritization

> *I didn’t just track projects — I exposed financial risk and enabled proactive decisions.*

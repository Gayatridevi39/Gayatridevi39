🎯 **About Me**

I'm Gayatri Devi Kajuluri — a developer and aspiring AI Engineer who enjoys turning complex problems into intelligent, real-world solutions.  
I’ve worked on impactful projects like:

- 🧠 **MediMind** — an AI-powered medical report summarizer using LangChain, Gemini API & Streamlit  
- 🤖 **CareerBot** — a personalized career assistant using Gemini & real-time content retrieval  
- 💸 **ChitFund Manager** — a Firebase-based dashboard for managing auctions and member dues

I believe in building tools that **empower people**, **simplify tasks**, and **drive real-world value** — not just experiments.
